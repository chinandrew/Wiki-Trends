- how to write optimization stuf
	- each t for gradient
	- t< t_0 for soft threshold
	- vector vs summation notation?
	- elementwise operations in calculation, gradient from sum



MSE of l2 pred_a vs gen_a


oddities
- same a_0 for sparse and dense
- difference between parallel and single threadS

- probabilities go to 0 when generating for grid, doesnt really happen for WS

RESULTS

- lambda = 0.0005 not very sparse, higher precision(76.2 vs 66.5) for top half
- lambda = 0.005 , 660 nonzero elements
- lambda = 0.008 , 9 nonzero elements, but all negative


extra iterations leads to same nonzero elements, but increases their magnitude by.. 50% ish, but still far less than true b(2 vs 100)
