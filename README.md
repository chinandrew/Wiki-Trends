## Coding and Experiments 
1. Clean and separate the base code in jl file : documentation, using should work, maybe create custom types, etc.
1. Systemetize the simulation - obtain many plots with different choices of SNR, generating initial graphs, generating b vector (see the GTF paper for 3 versions)
 * Evaluation metrics: PR curve, KL divergence (differential entropy), 2-norm (or infty norm) btw a
 * Interesting regimes: sparse graphs, dense graphs, larger graphs (trends in eval metrics over time)
1. Datasets: hep citations, wikipedia

## Writing
1. Filling out the model @JS
1. Optimization details (derivations in supplement) @AC
1. Intro & Related Work @JS
1. Write up experiments - later
